# REST_Tutorial_Full
First Web API developed using Django REST Framework by following their official tutorial  
  
Learned how to set up serializers, how requests and responses work, how to use class-based, function-based, and generic views.  
Practiced with user authentication and permissions for write operations  

Finally, shortened code by converting views to ViewSets and url congurations to a route object that handles the configuration for you.  

Final App allows users to browse code snippets and highlights as well as who posted them. The UI is generated through the Browsable API  
to give a nice clean interface for testing the API endpoints and viewing the data.  

Data storage uses built in SQLite DB.
